# Memcached architecture (I)
Memcached follows a client-server architecture.

| Characteristics       | Description         | 
| --------------------- |:------------------- | 
| 1     | Clients and servers are physically separated, so, its functionality. This helps with independent development and scalability.     |
| 2     | Functionality is divided into several servers (distributed system)                                                                |
| 3     | Users query the server and then, the server answers back                                                                          |

# Memcached architecture (II)
It's made up of four main components that work together to 
retrieve data as **efficiently** as possible.

# Memcached architecture (III)
| Component       | Description         | 
| --------------- |:------------------- | 
| Client software                       | List of available Memcached servers                   | 
| A client-based hashing algorithm      | Chooses the server based on the key                   | 
| Server software                       | Stores pairs of key/value into an internal hash table | 
| LRU                                   | Determines when to remove old data or reuse memory    |
